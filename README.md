## 🧩 What is AK Theory?

**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** is a mathematically rigorous,  
category-theoretic and topological formalism designed to resolve obstruction-based problems  
across PDEs, number theory, and algebraic geometry.

It introduces a structured collapse framework based on:

- **Persistent Homology (PH₁)**
- **Ext-class cohomological obstructions (Ext¹)**
- **Smoothness realization via energy decay**
- **Type-theoretic formalization (Coq/Lean-compatible)**
- **ZFC-based axiomatic foundation**

Version 10.0 finalizes the type-theoretic realization, classifier logic, and functorial constructions.

## 🧠 Philosophical Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may not be false — they may be underdimensioned.”

AK Theory is grounded in the belief that:

- Many deep mathematical obstructions (e.g., singularities, unsplit extensions, functional divergence)  
  are not intrinsic contradictions but **dimensionally insufficient formulations**.

- By **lifting** these problems into high-dimensional, MECE-partitioned projection spaces,  
  they can be **resolved** through **structural collapse**: vanishing of PH₁ and Ext¹,  
  leading to **smoothness, regularity, or abelianization**.

---

## 🧭 Scope of AK Theory

AK Theory addresses:

- **Topological collapse zones and filtered degeneration spaces**
- **Causal logic between PH₁, Ext¹, and energy-smoothness**
- **Functorial collapse under category theory**
- **Formal proof chains interpretable in Coq, Lean, or ZFC**
- **Arithmetic collapse over number fields, zeta limits, and class number formula**
- **Unified collapse typing for Mirror symmetry, Langlands duality, and Fukaya categories**

## 🔧 Core Collapse Framework

The fundamental causal equivalence is:

\[
\mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad u(t) \in C^\infty
\]

Where:
- PH₁: Persistent homology (topological cycles)
- Ext¹: Obstruction cohomology
- \( u(t) \): Flow or solution object (e.g., PDE velocity field)

Collapse is defined via:

- **CollapseZone(x)**: PH₁ vanishes locally
- **CollapseSheaf**: Filtered objects satisfying global PH₁ = 0 and Ext¹ = 0
- **CollapseFunctor**: \( F \mapsto F' \) preserving collapse structure
- **CollapseClassifier**: Typing scheme (Type I–IV) for degeneration states

## 🚀 What Can AK Theory Do?

### ✅ Collapse Completion Theorem  
If \( \mathcal{F}_t \) satisfies PH₁ = 0 and Ext¹ = 0,  
then the induced object \( u(t) \in C^\infty \) (smooth function or flow).  
Formalized via Π-type judgments in Coq (TT.15).

### ✅ Collapse–Zeta Correspondence  
Collapse energy \( E(t) \) satisfying decay induces convergence of  
\[
\int_0^\infty E(t) e^{-t} dt \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Zeta-regularity}
\]

Used to interpret class number finiteness and BSD consequences.

### ✅ Collapse Typing System  
Encodes object structure via type-theoretic classifiers:  
Type I (Ext), Type II (PH), Type III (smooth), Type IV (singular)

### ✅ CollapseFunctor Category  
Collapse-preserving functors maintain PH₁ and Ext¹ vanishing  
under colimits, pullbacks, composition (A11–A13, TT.7–TT.9)
