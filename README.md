# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v4.5)

## ✨ Overview
This repository presents the **Version 4.5** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**.  
AK-HDPST is a universal, categorical–topological framework for resolving complex mathematical structures by **lifting problems into structured high-dimensional spaces**.  

v4.5 introduces derived category interpretations and mirror symmetry structures, and integrates the complete proof strategy for **global regularity of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations**.

## 📌 Motivation
> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

By projecting dynamics into categorical, topological, and spectral spaces, AK-HDPST decomposes chaotic behavior into **MECE** clusters. These clusters collapse through persistent homology and energy decay, exposing hidden regularity and enabling analytical control.

## 🆕 What's New in Version 4.5

- **Extended Step 7**: Formalizes the categorical collapse of PH₁ via Ext-groups and derived functors.
- **New Functionals**: \( C(t), H(t), \Theta(t) \) track topological energy, entropy, and disorder.
- **Mirror Symmetry Interpretation**: Barcode collapse linked with SYZ-type torus degeneration.
- **Appendices Added**:
  - Glossary of PH terms and derived structures
  - TeX-based diagram for dyadic decay
  - Theorem: PH₁ collapse implies Ext¹ triviality
  - SYZ–Tropical duality diagram for geometric interpretation
- **Full alignment with Navier–Stokes Global Regularity v5.0** (proof-level application)

## 🧪 Applications

- **🌀 Navier–Stokes Global Regularity (v5.0)**  
  - Excludes Type I–III singularities  
  - Establishes \( H^1 \) regularity via topological triviality  
  - Confirms decay of energy, complexity, and loop structures  

- **🌊 Euler, SQG, MHD Equations**  
- **🧬 Topological Learning in Neural Manifolds**  
- **📊 Spectral Collapse in Information Dynamics**

## 🚨 Informal Main Theorem

> If a system admits:
> 1. Projection into MECE fiber structure,
> 2. Topological decay: \( C(t) \to 0, H(t) \to 0 \),
> 3. PH collapse in derived category (Extⁱ = 0),

> then the system exhibits **global regularity and categorical resolution**.

## 📝 arXiv Submission Statement

This version (v4.5) unifies algebraic topology, derived categories, mirror symmetry, and functional analysis into a singular framework applicable to PDEs. It culminates in a constructive and structurally verifiable route to resolving the 3D Navier–Stokes global regularity problem.

We respectfully submit this framework for arXiv consideration under **math.AP** / **math.AT**.  
We believe it serves both as a proof-level structure and as a prototype for generalized categorical PDE resolution frameworks.
