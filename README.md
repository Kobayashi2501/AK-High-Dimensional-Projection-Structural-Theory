# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v6.0)

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents the latest version of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a universal, categorical–topological framework for resolving complex mathematical structures by **lifting problems into structured high-dimensional spaces**.

Version 6.0 expands the scope of v5.0 by refining categorical collapse techniques and integrating advanced degeneration theory. Most notably, it enables a complete structural resolution of **Hilbert’s 12th Problem**, including the previously unsolved **real quadratic case**, and **proves the Nakai Conjecture**.

> 📌 **New**: AK-HDPST v6.0 provides a structural, category-theoretic proof of the **Hilbert 12th Problem (imaginary and real quadratic cases)**.

## 📌 Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

By projecting dynamics into categorical, topological, and spectral spaces, AK-HDPST decomposes chaotic behavior into **MECE** clusters. These clusters collapse through persistent homology and energy decay, exposing hidden regularity and enabling analytical control.

| 4 | VMHS-based degeneration tracking |
| 5 | Tropical collapse of persistent structures |
| 6 | Dyadic spectral decay of turbulence |
| 7 | Categorical collapse via Ext-groups (derived finality) |

## 📝 arXiv Submission Statement

AK-HDPST v6.0 unifies derived categories, algebraic topology, motivic degeneration, PDE regularity, and Ext-class collapse.  
It proves the global regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes, structurally resolves the Hilbert 12th Problem (both imaginary and real quadratic cases), and proves the Nakai Conjecture, establishing it as a universal categorical resolution framework.

> We submit this theory to arXiv under **math.CT**, **math.AG**, and **math.AP**.  
> We welcome collaboration and critical evaluation.
