# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v8.1)

📄 [日本語版 README (Japanese README Available Here)](README_jp.md)

---

## ✨ Overview

This repository contains **Version 8.1** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a categorical–topological framework designed to resolve complex mathematical obstructions by projecting them into structured high-dimensional spaces.

Version 8.1 completes:
- The **formal Collapse Completion Theorem** (Appendix Final)
- Full **ZFC-formalization of Collapse Axioms** (Appendix Z)
- Integration of **Langlands duality, mirror symmetry, and motivic degeneration**
- AI-driven **collapse zone classification** (Appendix L, Final.5)

The core structure is:

\[ \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad u(t) \in C^\infty \]

## 🎯 Motivation and Uniqueness

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

### What can AK-HDPST do?

- Projects singularities, gluing failures, or derived-category obstructions into **higher-dimensional categorical and spectral spaces**.
- Resolves them via **collapse logic** (PH vanishing, Ext$^1$ vanishing, VMHS degeneration).
- Establishes smoothness, gluing success, and structural regularity.

### Novelty:

- Formalizes **collapse = regularity** via Ext/PH duality
- Bridges fields: TDA, Langlands, PDE, homological algebra
- Embeds tropical, Hodge, and motivic degeneration into categorical collapse diagrams
- Enables neural classification and visualization of collapse structures (Appendix L)

## 🌀 Applications

### 🔵 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)
Collapse Completion yields:
\[ \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Rightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty \]

### 🔹 [Hilbert's 12th Problem (AK Collapse)](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)
Collapse logic realizes abelianization and special function constructions for both imaginary and real fields.

### 💎 [BSD Conjecture](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-the-BSD-Conjecture-via-AK-Theory)
Collapse structure formalizes:
\[ \mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_E, \mathbb{Q}_\ell) = 0 \Rightarrow \Sha(E) = 0 \Rightarrow \text{rank} = \operatorname{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s) \]

### 🌐 Langlands, Mirror, and Motives
Via Appendix I+, collapse structure unifies Langlands duality, mirror symmetry, and motivic flows through Ext-vanishing.

### 🤖 AI-based Collapse Classifiers
Appendix L introduces neural classifiers over PH, Ext, and tropical structures.

## 📄 Collapse Axioms (Appendix Z)

| Axiom | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| A1 | High-dimensional projection preserves MECE topology |
| A2 | PH$_1$ vanishing implies Sobolev regularity |
| A3 | Ext$^1$ vanishing eliminates obstruction class |
| A4 | VMHS degeneration stabilizes PH/Ext collapse |
| A5 | Topological energy and Ext are dual |
| A6 | VMHS degeneration → Ext + PH collapse |
| A7 | Dyadic decay implies Ext$^1$ = 0 |
| A8 | AI diagnostics match collapse categories |
| A9 | BSD follows via Ext/PH/Sha diagram |
| Z.9 | Collapse Lemma: PH$_1$ + Ext + decay ⇒ smoothness |
| Final.1 | Collapse system is complete: \( u \in C^\infty \) ⇔ full collapse |
