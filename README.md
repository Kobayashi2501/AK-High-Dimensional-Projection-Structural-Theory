# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v7.3)

📄 [日本語版 README（Japanese README Available Here）] (README_jp.md)

---

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 7.3** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a universal, categorical–topological framework designed to resolve complex mathematical obstructions by lifting them into structured high-dimensional spaces.

Version 7.3 completes the **formal Collapse Lemma** (Appendix Z.9), finalizes the **Ext–PH–Smoothness collapse equivalence**, and unifies the system across PDE, arithmetic geometry, category theory, and topological data analysis.  
The central structure is:

> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad u(t) \in C^\infty
> \]

## 📌 Motivation and Uniqueness

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

### 🧠 What can AK-HDPST do?

AK-HDPST lifts mathematical obstructions — such as singularities, glueing failures, or derived-category extensions — into high-dimensional categorical and spectral spaces.  
By decomposing these into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) clusters and applying collapse procedures (PH vanishing, Ext$^1$-vanishing, tropical/VMHS degeneration), the framework enables:

- **Resolution of analytic PDE singularities (e.g., Navier–Stokes)**
- **Algebraic reinterpretation of arithmetic problems (e.g., BSD, Hilbert's 12th)**
- **Derived-categorical collapse of obstruction logic**
- **Integration across multiple domains:**
  - Persistent Homology
  - Derived Categories / Topos Theory
  - Mixed Hodge Structures (VMHS)
  - Langlands Program
  - Mirror Symmetry
  - AI-enhanced classification of collapse zones

### 🆕 Why is it novel?

- Provides a **unified collapse logic** across topology, category theory, and spectral analysis  
- Uses Ext–PH duality to bypass pointwise estimates in PDE and number theory  
- Can bridge **previously disjoint fields** (e.g., Ext theory in algebraic geometry and PH in TDA)
- Proposes a formal framework where **obstruction = structure**, and collapse = smoothness

| 5 | VMHS degeneration and filtered collapse |
| 6 | Spectral decay: dyadic shell contraction |
| 7 | Collapse realization: Ext$^1$ ⇔ PH₁ ⇔ Smoothness (formalized in Z.9) |

## 🧪 Applications

### 🌀 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)
> Collapse Lemma ensures:
> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Rightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty
> \]

### 🔷 [Hilbert’s 12th Problem (AK Structural Proof)](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)
- Imaginary fields: collapse realizes \( K^{ab} \)
- Real fields: Ext–PH collapse implies abelianization
- Special functions reconstructed via AK-derived category

### 🧮 BSD Conjecture
- Appendix I formalizes BSD as:
> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_E, \mathbb{Q}_\ell) = 0 \Rightarrow \Sha(E) = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{rank}(E) = \mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s)
> \]

### 🌐 Langlands–Mirror–VMHS Synthesis
- Appendix I+ connects degeneration and Langlands duality through Ext-collapse logic

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Collapse Classification
- Appendix L embeds PH₁ and Ext-collapse types into diagnostic learning pipelines
