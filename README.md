# AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v1.5)

## Overview

This repository contains the formalized theory and LaTeX source of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**, version 1.5. This version introduces a categorical and functorial extension to the MECE projection framework originally defined in version 1.4.

## Motivation

AK-HDPST was conceived to reframe difficult mathematical problems in a higher-dimensional space where structural decomposition becomes possible. The theory assumes that such problems can be projected into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) groups whose behavior can be independently analyzed and recombined. 

Version 1.5 advances this framework by formalizing the projection and reconstruction processes as *functors* between structured categories and modeling MECE groupings as *fibered structures*.

## Key Concepts

- **Structured Categories**: Spaces and transformations preserving topological or differential properties.
- **Projection Functor (Φ)**: A functor between categories that maps objects and morphisms while preserving structure.
- **Fibered MECE Covering**: A decomposition of the projected space into disjoint and complete fibers, each representing a MECE group.
- **Stability Diagrams**: Time-evolving diagrams (e.g., persistent homology) attached to each group, which must converge.
- **Pseudoinverse Functor (Ψ)**: A partial inverse for Φ allowing reconstruction in stable regions.

## Axioms (v1.5)

1. **Functorial Projectability**: Φ is a functor in a structured category.
2. **Fibered MECE Decomposability**: Projected space can be expressed as the union of MECE fibers.
3. **Stability Diagram Convergence**: Persistent features of each fiber converge over time.
4. **Functorial Recoverability**: A partial inverse Ψ allows smooth recovery of original structure.

## Main Theorem

> If axioms A1'–A4' hold, then the evolution of the original space under projection Φ and recovery Ψ is globally smooth. No singularities can emerge if each fiber diagram converges.

## Files

- `ak_theory_v1_5.tex`: Full LaTeX source of the theory (v1.5)
- `README.md`: This documentation
- (optional) `structure_diagram.png`: Diagrammatic illustration (to be added)

## Future Directions

- Introduce enriched categorical structures (e.g., metric-enriched, probabilistic)
- Develop diagrammatic proof systems
- Apply AK-HDPST to Navier–Stokes, number theory, and beyond
