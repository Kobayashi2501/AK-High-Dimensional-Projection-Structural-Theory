# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v7.0)

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 7.0** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a categorical–topological framework designed to resolve complex mathematical problems by lifting them into structured high-dimensional spaces.

Version 7.0 completes the formal **Ext–PH–Trop Collapse Equivalence**, incorporates **VMHS degeneration** via derived geometry, and establishes a robust 14-part **Appendix system** spanning from collapse logic to AI-augmented classification.

> 📌 **Update**: This version finalizes the categorical collapse loop:  
> **Ext$^1$ = 0 ⇔ PH₁ = 0 ⇔ Smoothness**,  
> enabling internal realization of special functions and structural resolutions of several conjectures.

## 📌 Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

AK-HDPST lifts mathematical obstructions into high-dimensional categorical and spectral layers, decomposing complex systems into MECE clusters. These clusters collapse through persistent homology (PH₁), Ext-group vanishing, and tropical degeneration, yielding analytic and geometric regularity.

## 🧠 Core Collapse Architecture

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Motivational Lifting and Topological Barcode Initialization |
| 1 | PH₁ Stabilization via Sobolev Space Continuity |
| 2 | Topological Energy Collapse through Functional \( C(t) \) |
| 3 | Blow-up Exclusion via Nerve Trivialization |
| 4 | Categorical Collapse Diagram: Derived Ext ⇔ PH₁ |
| 5 | Degeneration via VMHS and Hodge Filtration |
| 6 | Spectral Collapse: Dyadic Fourier Energy Decay |
| 7 | Final Collapse Realization: Ext$^1$ ⇔ PH₁ ⇔ Smoothness |

*All steps are formally supported in Appendix Z.*

## 🧪 Applications

### 🌀 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)
- Collapse logic ensures:
  \[
  \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty
  \]

### 🔷 [Hilbert’s 12th Problem (AK Structural Proof)](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)
- Imaginary case: AK-sheaf orbit degeneration recovers \( K^{ab} \)
- Real case: PH₁ and Ext collapse imply abelianization
- Special functions are internally realized in the derived AK category

### 📐 Nakai Conjecture (Reversed Grothendieck)
- Finite generation of \( D(V) \Rightarrow V \) smooth via:
  \[
  \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Smoothness}
  \]

### 🧮 BSD Collapse and Selmer–Ext Equivalence
- Appendix I outlines a motivic reformulation of the BSD conjecture in collapse form

### 🌐 Langlands–Mirror–Trop Collapse (Appendix K)
- Functorial synthesis connecting arithmetic degenerations with geometric and categorical collapse

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Classification (Appendix L)
- Integration of PH₁-based topological features into machine learning pipelines for PDE and algebraic structures
