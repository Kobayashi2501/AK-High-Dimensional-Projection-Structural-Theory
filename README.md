## 🔷 Overview

This repository introduces a new mathematical framework named **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**.  
It aims to approach complex mathematical problems by projecting them into higher-dimensional structured spaces, decomposing them into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) structural groups, and analyzing their stability to prove global smoothness and prevent singularities.

## 🧠 Core Idea

> **"Difficult problems in low-dimensional form often become tractable when projected into structured high-dimensional group spaces."**

AK-HDPST combines topological persistence, geometric continuity, and group-theoretic decomposition to yield proof strategies applicable across fields (e.g., fluid dynamics, number theory, logic systems).

## 🧩 Framework Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Projection Space** \(\mathcal{P}_n\) | Higher-dimensional space derived from original domain \(\mathcal{X}\) using structure-preserving map \(\Phi\). |
| **MECE Group Decomposition** \(\{G_i\}\) | Disjoint and exhaustive partition of \(\mathcal{P}_n\) reflecting structural clusters. |
| **Stability Function** \(S(G_i, t)\) | Time-dependent measure (e.g., PH distance, energy decay) for each group \(G_i\). |
| **Inverse Projection** \(\Phi^{-1}\) | Recovers smooth structure in \(\mathcal{X}\) from stable structure in \(\mathcal{P}_n\). |

## 📜 Axioms (v1.4)

- **A1. Projectability:** There exists a continuous structure-preserving map \(\Phi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{P}\).
- **A2. MECE Decomposability:** \(\mathcal{P}\) can be partitioned into closed, disjoint, exhaustive groups \(\{G_i\}\).
- **A3. Local Stability:** Each group admits a convergent structural stability function \(S_i(t)\).
- **A4. Recoverability:** Smooth inverse mapping \(\Phi^{-1}\) exists on each group domain.

## 🔍 Lemmas and Theorem

- ✅ **Lemma 1:** If groups are connected and adjacent, \(\mathcal{P}\) is globally connected.
- ✅ **Lemma 2:** Convergence of \(S_i(t)\) implies smoothness of \(\Phi^{-1}|_{G_i}\).
- ✅ **Lemma 3:** Local smoothness and continuity on groups yield global continuity of \(\Phi^{-1}\).
- ✅ **Main Theorem:** If all axioms and lemma conditions are met, the original space \(\mathcal{X}(t)\) is globally smooth.
- 🔒 **Corollary:** No singularities (e.g. blow-up) arise in \(\mathcal{X}(t)\).

  - 🔄 Logical proposition flow (syntactic projection)
- Introduce categorical diagrams and functor-based projections
- ArXiv submission & community peer review
