# AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v1.6)

## Overview
This repository contains the formalized theory and LaTeX source of the AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST), version 1.6. This version unifies the topological, algebraic, and numerical insights of the AK projection framework, with explicit application to fluid dynamics (Navier–Stokes) and theoretical extensibility to logic, number theory, and geometry.

## Motivation
AK-HDPST was originally conceived to reframe difficult mathematical problems in a higher-dimensional space where structural decomposition becomes possible. The central assumption is:

> "Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension."

In this version (v1.6), the framework incorporates persistent homology, cluster-wise Lyapunov control, and degeneration via tropical and Hodge-theoretic mechanisms, forming a closed feedback loop:

```
Topological Simplification ⇄ Orbit Compression ⇄ Proof Tractability
```

## New in Version 1.6
- Fully formalized LaTeX documentation (`ak_projection_theory_v1.6.tex`)
- Numerical realization tools for orbit projection, PH computation, and spectral decay
- Persistent collapse linked to regularity via VMHS + tropical degeneration
- Application to 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes global regularity (v3.2)
- Advanced section on higher-dimensional PH, moduli boundary structure, and visual diagnostics

## Key Concepts
- **AK Projection Space**: High-dimensional embedding where group or topological simplification becomes tractable
- **MECE Cluster Structure**: Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive decomposition into analyzable units
- **Persistent Lyapunov Energy**: $C(t) = \sum \mathrm{persist}(h)^2$ acting as topological energy
- **VMHS Degeneration**: Barcode evolution modeled via mixed Hodge structure collapse
- **Tropical Stability**: Piecewise-linear convergence of persistent signatures

## Main Theorem
If the projected structure $\pi(X)$ admits a MECE decomposition with decaying persistent complexity and VMHS degeneration, then the original space $X$ is globally regular. That is:

> No singularity can emerge when each cluster collapses persistently.
