## 🧩 What is AK Theory?

**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** is a mathematically rigorous,  
category-theoretic and topological formalism designed to resolve obstruction-based problems  
across PDEs, number theory, and algebraic geometry.

It introduces a structured collapse framework based on:

- `Persistent Homology (PH₁)`
- `Ext-class cohomological obstructions (Ext¹)`
- `Smoothness realization via energy decay`
- `Type-theoretic formalization (Coq/Lean-compatible)`
- `ZFC-based axiomatic foundation`

Version 10.0 finalizes the type-theoretic realization, classifier logic, and functorial constructions.

## 🧠 Philosophical Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may not be false — they may be underdimensioned.”

AK Theory is grounded in the belief that:

- Many deep mathematical obstructions (e.g., singularities, unsplit extensions, functional divergence)  
  are not intrinsic contradictions but **dimensionally insufficient formulations**.

- By **lifting** these problems into high-dimensional, MECE-partitioned projection spaces,  
  they can be **resolved** through **structural collapse**: vanishing of `PH₁` and `Ext¹`,  
  leading to `smoothness`, `regularity`, or `abelianization`.

---

## 🧭 Scope of AK Theory

AK Theory addresses:

- `Topological collapse zones` and `filtered degeneration spaces`
- `Causal logic` between `PH₁`, `Ext¹`, and `energy-smoothness`
- `Functorial collapse` under category theory
- `Formal proof chains` interpretable in Coq, Lean, or ZFC
- `Arithmetic collapse` over number fields, zeta limits, and class number formula
- `Unified collapse typing` for Mirror symmetry, Langlands duality, and Fukaya categories

---

## 🔧 Core Collapse Framework

The fundamental causal equivalence is:

`PH₁ = 0  ⇔  Ext¹ = 0  ⇒  u(t) ∈ C^∞`

Where:
- `PH₁`: Persistent homology (topological cycles)
- `Ext¹`: Obstruction cohomology
- `u(t)`: Flow or solution object (e.g., PDE velocity field)

Collapse is defined via:

- `CollapseZone(x)`: `PH₁` vanishes locally
- `CollapseSheaf`: Filtered objects satisfying global `PH₁ = 0` and `Ext¹ = 0`
- `CollapseFunctor`: `F ↦ F'` preserving collapse structure
- `CollapseClassifier`: Typing scheme (Type I–IV) for degeneration states

---

## 🚀 What Can AK Theory Do?

### ✅ Collapse Completion Theorem  
If `ℱₜ` satisfies `PH₁ = 0` and `Ext¹ = 0`,  
then the induced object `u(t) ∈ C^∞` (smooth function or flow).  
Formalized via `Π`-type judgments in Coq (TT.15).

### ✅ Collapse–Zeta Correspondence  
Collapse energy `E(t)` satisfying decay induces convergence of  
`∫₀^∞ E(t) e^(–t) dt  ⇒  Zeta-regularity`

Used to interpret class number finiteness and BSD consequences.

### ✅ Collapse Typing System  
Encodes object structure via type-theoretic classifiers:  
Type I (Ext), Type II (PH), Type III (smooth), Type IV (singular)

### ✅ CollapseFunctor Category  
Collapse-preserving functors maintain `PH₁` and `Ext¹` vanishing  
under colimits, pullbacks, composition (`A11–A13`, `TT.7–TT.9`)

---

### 🔵 Navier–Stokes Global Regularity (Collapse NS Theorem)  
From `PH₁(ℱₜ) = 0` and `Ext¹(ℱₜ, ℚ) = 0`, and with collapse energies `E_PH(t), E_Ext(t) → 0`,  
we derive: `u(t,x) ∈ C^∞(ℝ³ × [0, ∞))`  
→ [`navier-stokes-global-regularity`](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)

✅ Completion Status  
This version completes the structural proof of the **global regularity** of 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations under:

- PH₁ collapse (topological vortex class eliminated)  
- Ext¹ vanishing (categorical obstruction removed)  
- Energy decay: `E_PH(t), E_Ext(t) → 0` as `t → ∞`  
- ZFC + MLTT (type theory) formalization

Thus, formally:

**PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ E → 0 ⇒ u(t,x) ∈ C^∞(ℝ³ × [0, ∞))**

---

### 📉 BSD Conjecture (Collapse BSD Theorem)  
From `PH₁(E) = 0` and `Ext¹(ℚ, E[n]) = 0`, we derive  
`rank_ℤ E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)` via analytic-classifier correspondence  
→ [`bsd-collapse-theorem`](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-the-BSD-Conjecture-via-AK-Theory)

✅ Completion Status  
This version completes the structural proof of the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture** under:

- PH₁ collapse of the moduli sheaf  
- Ext¹ vanishing over ℚℓ  
- Analytic rank equals algebraic rank  
- ZFC + type-theoretic consistency (Coq-formalizable)

Thus, formally:

**PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ rank_ℤ E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)**

---

### 🧮 ABC Conjecture (Collapse ABC Theorem)  
From `PH₁(Fₐᵦ𝑐) = 0` and `Ext¹ = 0`, energy decay `E(t) ≤ Ae^−κt` implies  
`log c ≤ (1 + ε) log rad(abc)`  
→ [`collapse-abc-theorem`](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Collapse-Theoretic-Proof-of-the-ABC-Conjecture/tree/main)

✅ Completion Status  
This version completes the structural proof of the ABC conjecture under:

- PH₁ collapse (persistent homology trivial)  
- Ext¹ vanishing (derived obstruction removed)  
- Collapse energy decay  
- ZFC + MLTT (type theory) consistency  

Thus, formally:

**PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ E(t) ≤ Ae^−κt ⇒ log c ≤ (1 + ε) log rad(abc)**

---

### 💠 Riemann Hypothesis (Collapse RH Resolution)  
If `PH₁(𝓜_ζ) = 0` holds for the zeta moduli collapse sheaf,  
then non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on `Re(s) = 1/2`  
→ [`collapse-riemann-hypothesis`](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/A-Formal-Collapse-Resolution-of-the-Riemann-Hypothesis-via-AK-Theory/tree/main)

✅ Completion Status  
This version completes a formal resolution of RH under:

- Collapse axioms (A0–A9)  
- Ext-layer vanishing  
- Topological + categorical obstruction removal  
- Final mapping to `Re(s) = 1/2`

Thus, formally:

**If PH₁(𝓜_ζ) = 0 ⇒ Re(s) = 1/2 for all non-trivial zeros of ζ(s)**

---

### 💠 Hilbert's 12th Problem (Collapse Hilbert12 Resolution)  
If `PH₁(𝓕_K) = 0` and `Ext¹(𝓕_K, ℚₗ) = 0` hold for the collapse-compatible sheaf over a number field K,  
then there exists an explicit transcendental generator `x ∈ K^{ab}`.  
→ [`collapse-hilbert12`](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)

✅ Completion Status  
This version completes a formal resolution of Hilbert's 12th Problem under:

- Collapse axioms (A0–A9)  
- Functorial PH₁ / Ext¹ collapse chain  
- Type-theoretic generator realization via Π/Σ predicates  
- Coq/Lean-compatible QED (Appendix H)

Thus, formally:

**If PH₁(𝓕_K) = 0 ∧ Ext¹(𝓕_K, ℚₗ) = 0 ⇒ ∃ x ∈ CollapseImage(𝓕_K) ⊆ K^{ab}**

This includes all transcendental types:

- Type I: `j(τ)` for imaginary quadratic fields  
- Type II: `exp(2πiα)`, `Γ(z)` for ℚ and real fields  
- Type III: `θ[ε](τ, z)` and Siegel modular forms for higher CM fields

### 📘 Class Number & Zeta Collapse  
Collapse energy translates into Zeta-type integrals  
→ Appendix `J`, `K`, `TT.11`

### 💎 Langlands Collapse Sheaf  
`Ext¹(M, ℚₗ) = 0` induces self-duality ≅ Galois equivalence  
→ `TT.12`, `TT.13`

### 🧠 Fukaya/Mirror Collapse  
Collapse sheaves functorially map to Fukaya categories  
→ `TT.14`, Appendix `O`
