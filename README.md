# AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v4.2)

## Overview
This repository contains the complete formalization of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**, version 4.2. This version presents a categorical, topological, and geometric framework for decomposing complex mathematical structures via high-dimensional projections, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics (Navier‚ÄìStokes) to logic and geometry.

## Motivation
AK-HDPST was originally conceived with the insight:

> ‚ÄúUnsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.‚Äù

By projecting difficult problems into structured higher-dimensional spaces, the theory enables decomposition into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) clusters governed by topological and algebraic regularities.

Version 4.2 integrates:
- Persistent Homology collapse and Lyapunov-type functionals
- Categorical MECE decomposition using fibered categories
- Degeneration mechanisms via VMHS and tropical geometry
- Concrete application to the global regularity of 3D Navier‚ÄìStokes (v3.2)

## What's New in Version 4.2
- **Categorical Formalization**: Functorial MECE clustering and structural fiber categories
- **PH-Based Lyapunov Functionals**: Topological energy $C(t) = \sum \mathrm{persist}(h)^2$
- **Degeneration Mechanisms**: Variation of Mixed Hodge Structures (VMHS) + Tropical contraction
- **Mirror Symmetry Integration**: SYZ tropical degeneration for structural duality
- **Expanded Applications**: Application to Navier‚ÄìStokes (v3.2), MHD, and active scalar models
- **Critical Space Extension**: Besov and BMO$^{-1}$ compatibility via wavelet-based PH

## Core Concepts
- **AK Projection Space**: A high-dimensional structured category where analysis and simplification become tractable
- **MECE Cluster Structure**: A functorial decomposition into disjoint analyzable fibers
- **Persistent Topological Energy**: $C(t)$ as a Lyapunov-type measure of topological complexity
- **VMHS Collapse**: Barcode degeneration modeled via Hodge-theoretic variation
- **Tropical Stability**: Piecewise-linear contraction of barcode paths in moduli space
- **Mirror Categorical Duality**: Topological‚Äìalgebraic‚Äìgeometric duality via SYZ-type mirror symmetry

## Main Theorem (Simplified Form)
If a high-dimensional projection $\pi: X \to \mathcal{C}$ admits:
1. A MECE decomposition into fibered clusters,
2. Persistent homology energy decay $C(t) \to 0$,
3. VMHS and tropical degeneration of barcode structures,

then the original system $X$ is **globally regular**‚Äîno singularities or pathologies can persist within such a structure.

> **Structural regularity arises when every cluster collapses persistently and algebraically.**
