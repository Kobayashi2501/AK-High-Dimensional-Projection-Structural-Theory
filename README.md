# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v5.0)

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 5.0** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**.  
AK-HDPST is a universal, categorical–topological framework for resolving complex mathematical structures by **lifting problems into structured high-dimensional spaces**.

Version 5.0 integrates Langlands-type functorial degeneration, motivic Ext-collapse, and AI-assisted persistent classification.  
It structurally resolves the global regularity of the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, reconstructs Hilbert’s 12th Problem (imaginary quadratic case), and now proves the Nakai Conjecture through categorical collapse.

> 📌 **New**: AK-HDPST v5.0 structurally proves the **Nakai Conjecture**, reversing Grothendieck’s implication:  
> **Finitely generated ring of differential operators ⇒ geometric smoothness**.

## 📌 Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

By projecting dynamics into categorical, topological, and spectral spaces, AK-HDPST decomposes chaotic behavior into **MECE** clusters. These clusters collapse through persistent homology and energy decay, exposing hidden regularity and enabling analytical control.

## 📝 arXiv Submission Statement

AK-HDPST v5.0 unifies derived categories, algebraic topology, motivic degeneration, PDE regularity, and Ext-class collapse.  
It proves the global regularity of 3D Navier–Stokes, reconstructs Hilbert’s 12th Problem, and structurally resolves the Nakai Conjecture, establishing it as a universal categorical resolution framework.

> We submit this theory to arXiv under **math.CT**, **math.AG**, and **math.AP**.  
> We believe it offers a new paradigm for structural resolution of classical conjectures.
