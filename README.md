# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v9.0)

📄 [日本語版 README (Japanese README Available Here)](README_jp.md)

---

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 9.0** of the  
**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a universal, categorical–topological framework  
designed to resolve complex mathematical obstructions by lifting them into structured high-dimensional spaces  
and resolving them via collapse logic and Ext-class vanishing.

Version 9.0 completes:

- The **Collapse Completion Theorem** (Appendix Final)
- Full **ZFC-compatible formalization of Collapse Axioms** (Appendix Z)
- Embedding of **Mirror symmetry, Langlands duality, and motivic degenerations**
- Collapse **Functor formalization** via Π-type and Σ-type (Appendix Z.12)
- AI-enhanced **collapse zone diagnostics and classification modules** (Appendix L)
- Complete integration of formal–structural collapse proof pipelines for applications to PDEs, number theory, and derived geometry

The core structure remains:

\[
\mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad u(t) \in C^\infty
\]

## 🎯 Motivation and Uniqueness

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

### What can AK-HDPST do?

AK-HDPST provides a formal method for:

- **Lifting obstructions** (e.g., gluing failure, singularities, Ext-class nontriviality) into higher-dimensional MECE-structured projection spaces
- **Resolving them via categorical collapse logic**, unifying persistent homology, Ext$^1$ vanishing, and geometric smoothness
- **Generating proof chains** across algebraic topology, PDE theory, Hodge degeneration, and derived categories
- **Classifying mathematical phases**, degeneration zones, and structural failure regions via AI-based classifiers
- **Reconstructing functions** required by classical conjectures (e.g., Hilbert's 12th, BSD) through collapse-generative mechanisms

### Novelty:

- Collapse completion establishes a **constructive path from topological to categorical to analytic resolution**
- Bridges disparate areas: TDA, Ext-functors, Mirror symmetry, Langlands correspondence, derived geometry
- Uses formal Π-type collapse functors for Coq/Lean-compatible formalization
- Enables **semantic AI diagnostics** and degeneration visualization (Appendix L, M++, Z.10)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | High-dimensional MECE projection of obstruction structure |
| 1 | PH$_1$ stability under Sobolev norms |

| 5 | Filtered VMHS degeneration ⇒ Collapse of Ext and PH |
| 6 | Dyadic spectral energy decay ⇒ Ext$^1$ vanishing |
| 7 | Collapse Realization: \( \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty \)

## 🌀 Applications

### 🔵 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)

Collapse completion yields:

\[
\mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Rightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty
\]

### 🔹 [Hilbert's 12th Problem](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)

Collapse logic constructs special functions and abelianizations for both imaginary and real fields.

### 💎 [BSD Conjecture](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-the-BSD-Conjecture-via-AK-Theory)

Collapse formalizes:

\[
\mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_E, \mathbb{Q}_\ell) = 0 \Rightarrow \Sha(E) = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{rank} = \operatorname{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s)
\]

### 🌐 Langlands, Mirror, and Motives

Appendix I+ unifies mirror symmetry, Langlands duality, and motivic degenerations under collapse classification.

### 🤖 AI-based Collapse Diagnostics

Appendix L introduces neural classifiers and diagnostic modules to classify collapse vs. failure zones across Ext/PH spaces.
