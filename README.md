# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v7.0)

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 7.0** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a universal, categorical–topological framework for resolving complex mathematical structures by **lifting problems into structured high-dimensional spaces**.

Version 7.0 extends the formal structure of v6.0 by completing the **Ext–PH–Trop Collapse Equivalence**, integrating **VMHS degeneration**, and introducing a 7-stage **Appendix roadmap** covering derived geometry, topological degeneration, and motivic correspondence.

> 📌 **Update**: v7.0 fully formalizes the Ext–PH–Smoothness collapse loop and supports internal realization of special functions via categorical degeneration, completing proofs of **Hilbert’s 12th Problem** and the **Nakai Conjecture**.

---

## 📌 Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

AK-HDPST projects chaotic or obstructed dynamics into higher-dimensional categorical and spectral spaces, decomposing complexity into **MECE** clusters. These clusters collapse through persistent homology, Ext-group vanishing, and tropical degeneration, enabling analytical and geometric control.

## 🧠 Core Collapse Architecture

| Step | Function |
|------|----------|
| 0 | Motivational Lifting and Barcode Definition |
| 1 | PH₁ Stabilization via Sobolev Continuity |
| 2 | Energy Collapse via Topological Functional \( C(t) \) |
| 3 | Injectivity and Nerve Trivialization |
| 4 | Derived Ext–PH Equivalence (Collapse Diagram) |
| 5 | VMHS-Induced Topological Degeneration |
| 6 | Spectral Energy Collapse via Dyadic Fourier Decay |
| 7 | Categorical Collapse Realization: Ext$^1$ ⇔ PH₁ ⇔ Smoothness |

All steps are structurally verified in Appendix Z.

## 🧪 Applications

- **🌀 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)**  
  - Derived–PH collapse proves smoothness: Ext$^1$ = 0 ⇔ PH₁ = 0 ⇔ \( u(t) \in C^\infty \)  

- **🔷 [Hilbert’s 12th Problem (Structural Proof)](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)**  
  - Imaginary case: AK-sheaf degeneration via modular unit orbit  
  - Real case: Ext-collapse induces internal abelianization  
  - No external modular functions needed — special functions are categorically realized  

- **📐 Nakai Conjecture**  
  - Reverses Grothendieck’s implication: finite generation of D(V) ⇒ V is smooth  
  - Proven via Ext-finality and PH₁ collapse in AK-derived category  

- **🔢 Langlands–Mirror–Trop Geometry**  
- **📊 Persistent Homology for Learning Geometry in Neural Flows**  
- **🌐 Categorical Collapse of Arithmetic and Motives**
