# 🌐 AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (v7.3)

## ✨ Overview

This repository presents **Version 7.3** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** — a universal, categorical–topological framework designed to resolve complex mathematical obstructions by lifting them into structured high-dimensional spaces.

Version 7.3 finalizes the **Collapse Lemma as a formal theorem**, stabilizes the **Ext–PH–Smoothness collapse loop**, integrates **VMHS degeneration**, and completes the 14-part Appendix system.  
The core result is:

> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad u(t) \in C^\infty
> \]

---

## 📌 Motivation

> “Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.”

AK-HDPST lifts complex problems into high-dimensional categorical and spectral layers, decomposing them into MECE clusters. These clusters collapse via persistent homology, Ext-group vanishing, and degeneration, yielding smoothness or abelianization.

## 🧠 Core Collapse Architecture

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Topological initialization and projection strategy |
| 1 | PH₁ stabilization under Sobolev continuity |
| 2 | Energy collapse via topological functional \( C(t) \) |
| 3 | Blow-up exclusion through trivial Nerve structure |
| 4 | Categorical diagram: Ext ⇔ PH correspondence |
| 5 | VMHS degeneration and filtered collapse |
| 6 | Spectral decay: dyadic shell contraction |
| 7 | Collapse realization: Ext$^1$ ⇔ PH₁ ⇔ Smoothness (formalized in Z.9) |

> All steps are formally supported in Appendix Z.

## 🧪 Applications

### 🌀 [Navier–Stokes Global Regularity](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/navier-stokes-global-regularity)
> Collapse Lemma ensures:
> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1 = 0 \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_1 = 0 \Rightarrow u(t) \in C^\infty
> \]

### 🔷 [Hilbert’s 12th Problem (AK Structural Proof)](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/Structural-Proof-of-Hilbert-s-12th-Problem-via-Categorical-Degeneration-in-AK-HDPST)
- Imaginary fields: collapse realizes \( K^{ab} \)
- Real fields: Ext–PH collapse implies abelianization
- Special functions reconstructed via AK-derived category

### 🧮 BSD Conjecture
- Appendix I formalizes BSD as:
> \[
> \mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{F}_E, \mathbb{Q}_\ell) = 0 \Rightarrow \Sha(E) = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{rank}(E) = \mathrm{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s)
> \]

### 🌐 Langlands–Mirror–VMHS Synthesis
- Appendix I+ connects degeneration and Langlands duality through Ext-collapse logic

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Collapse Classification
- Appendix L embeds PH₁ and Ext-collapse types into diagnostic learning pipelines
