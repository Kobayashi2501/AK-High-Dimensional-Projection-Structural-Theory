\section*{Introduction}

This paper proposes the \textbf{AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory} (AK理論), a general mathematical framework designed to structurally decompose complex problems by projecting them into higher-dimensional MECE-aligned cluster structures. The guiding principle is simple:

\begin{quote}
\textit{``Unsolvable problems may simply lack sufficient dimension.''}
\end{quote}

By identifying latent group-like or topologically trivial structures in a projected space, AK theory aims to make globally difficult problems locally tractable. This theory generalizes the approach used in the Navier--Stokes v3.2 framework and abstracts its mechanism for broader applicability.

\section{Core Definitions}

\begin{definition}[AK Projection Space]
Let $X$ be a mathematical structure (e.g., trajectory, orbit, equation class). An \textbf{AK projection} is a map $\pi : X \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that group or topological structures become analyzable in $\pi(X)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[MECE Cluster Structure]
A decomposition $\{C_i\}$ of $\pi(X)$ is \textbf{MECE} (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive) if each $C_i$ is disjoint and jointly covers $\pi(X)$, and each is analyzable via uniform criteria (e.g., topological class, spectral regime).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[AK Group Structure]
If each cluster $C_i$ admits a binary operation $*_i$ making $(C_i, *_i)$ a group or semi-group, then $\{(C_i, *_i)\}$ forms an \textbf{AK group structure}.
\end{definition}

\section{Structural Lemmas and Propositions}

\begin{lemma}[Projection Preserves Structure]
If $\pi$ is continuous and topology-preserving (e.g., via persistent homology), complexity metrics over $X$ can be translated into $\pi(X)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proposition}[Proof Reduction via Clusters]
If a problem $P$ decomposes into cluster-level propositions $P_i$ over $C_i$, and each $P_i$ is provable independently, then $P$ holds globally.
\end{proposition}

\section{Main Theorems}

\begin{theorem}[Topological Collapse Implies Regularity]
If persistent homology $\mathrm{PH}_1(C_i(t)) \to 0$ for all $i$, then the original structure $X$ exhibits regularity (e.g., Sobolev continuity).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[AK Resolution of Intractability]
If intractability localizes to cluster $C_j$, AK projection isolates $C_j$ for direct analysis or degeneration.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Degeneration via Moduli Structure]
If the cluster structure degenerates (e.g., via VHS or tropical collapse), then proof conditions can be formulated on the boundary of a moduli space.
\end{theorem}

\section{Feedback Loop}

AK theory postulates the following equivalence:
\[
\text{Topological Simplification} \Longleftrightarrow \text{Orbit Compression} \Longleftrightarrow \text{Proof Tractability}.
\]

\section{Application: Navier--Stokes Global Regularity}

As a concrete application of AK theory, we present its use in the 3D incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The solution orbit $\mathcal{O} = \{u(t) : t \geq 0\} \subset H^1$ was projected into a low-dimensional manifold via Isomap, and persistent homology showed $\mathrm{PH}_1(\mathcal{O}) = 0$. Cluster-level Lyapunov functions $C(t) = \sum \mathrm{persist}(h)^2$ decayed, implying orbit flattening. A degeneration structure was formulated using VMHS and tropical geometry.

\textbf{Conclusion:} All known blow-up types (I--III) were excluded. This validates the AK framework as a tool for converting analytic regularity into topological and algebraic terms.

\section{Advanced Structures: Higher PH and Degeneration Geometry}

\begin{definition}[Higher-Dimensional Persistent Projection]
For $k \geq 2$, the persistent homology group $\mathrm{PH}_k(X)$ tracks voids, chambers, and high-dimensional structure. These can be projected onto moduli-type coordinates for degeneration tracking.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[High-PH Collapse Implies Structural Simplicity]
If $\mathrm{PH}_k(C_i(t)) \to 0$ for $k=1,2,...,m$, then $X$ is homotopically trivial in projection. This implies combinatorial compressibility and algorithmic tractability.
\end{theorem}

\section{Visualization and Numeric Implementation}

AK projections can be numerically validated through the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{ph\_isomap.py} --- for Isomap + persistent homology of orbit structures.
  \item \texttt{fourier\_decay.py} --- spectral energy decay and shell slope estimation.
  \item Cech/Vietoris filtration modules for barcode simplification.
\end{itemize}

Diagrams showing barcode shortening, orbit flattening, and PH decay can illustrate the degeneration process central to AK collapse.

We acknowledge that this theory emerged as a generalization of empirical observations from the Navier--Stokes global regularity project (v3.2).
