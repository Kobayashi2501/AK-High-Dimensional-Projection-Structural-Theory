\begin{abstract}
This paper formulates the \textbf{AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)} as a general framework for addressing mathematically difficult problems. The core idea is to project such problems into a higher-dimensional space and decompose them into \textbf{Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE)} structural groups. This facilitates local analysis under global constraints, enabling structural clarity and proof strategies. 

The framework integrates Persistent Homology, Lyapunov-type functionals, tropical geometry, and degeneration of mixed Hodge structures to establish a unified topological–analytical–geometrical system. We reference the structural approach to the Navier–Stokes regularity problem (Kobayashi–ChatGPT, 2025) as a concrete instantiation of this abstract theory.

\section{Introduction: Motivation and Philosophy}
Many nonlinear PDEs and topological problems cannot be effectively visualized or controlled through low-dimensional or local methods. This theory begins with the philosophical premise:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{"Perhaps the reason a problem cannot be solved is simply that the dimension is too low."}
\end{quote}
Based on this belief, we propose a framework that merges high-dimensional projection, topological clustering, geometric degeneration, and analytical energy control.

\section{Core Structure of AK Theory: High-Dimensional Projections and MECE Decomposition}
\subsection{Definition: AK Projection and Fibered MECE Structure}
\begin{definition}[AK-Type Projection Structure]
Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(\mathcal{X}\) a category-structured space. A projection \(\Phi: X \to \mathcal{X}\) is called an AK-type projection if \(\mathcal{X}\) is structured as a fibered category, with each fiber forming a MECE topological cluster.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Fibered MECE Group Structure]
If \(\mathcal{X} = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i\) such that the sets \(X_i\) are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, then \(\mathcal{X}\) admits a fibered MECE decomposition.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Abstract Formulation of Lyapunov Functionals}
\begin{definition}[Topological Lyapunov Functional]
Define \(C(t) := \sum_{h\in PH_1(t)} \text{persist}(h)^2\) over a topological state space \(\mathcal{X}(t)\). We call this the topological Lyapunov functional. It quantifies structural degeneration and encodes energy dissipation over time.
\end{definition}

\section{Structure via Persistent Homology and Tropical Degeneration}
\subsection{VMHS Structures and Degeneration Description}
\begin{definition}[Degenerating Mixed Hodge Structure (VMHS)]
If the barcode series \(B(t)\) converges through degeneration of mixed Hodge structures, we say it undergoes VMHS degeneration.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Tropical Stability]
If \(\text{Trop}(B(t))\) is piecewise-linear, Lipschitz continuous, and converges to a boundary point, then \(B(t)\) is said to be tropically stable.
\end{definition}

\section{General Theorems and Feedback Structure in AK Theory}
\begin{theorem}[Bidirectional Link between PH\(_1\) and Regularity]
Suppose \(PH_1(t) = 0\) and \(C(t)\) satisfies Lyapunov-type decay. Then the corresponding state \(u(t)\) has temporal H\(^1\)-regularity. Conversely, such regularity also implies topological triviality.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
A feedback loop exists: \(PH_1(t) = 0 \iff u(t) \in C^\beta_t H^1_x\).
\end{corollary}

\section{Application Example: Structural Strategy in Navier–Stokes v3.2}
\subsection{Overview}
Navier–Stokes v3.2 (Kobayashi–ChatGPT, 2025) implements the AK theory's topological–analytical strategy in full. Through concrete functionals \(C(t)\), entropy \(H(t)\), and tropical degeneration, it demonstrates the equivalence between regularity and topological triviality \(PH_1 = 0\).

\subsection{Correspondence with AK Theory}
\begin{itemize}
  \item PH\(_1(t)\): Indicator of topological complexity \(\rightarrow\) Degeneration metric in AK theory
  \item \(C(t)\): Lyapunov-type functional \(\rightarrow\) Realization of energy-based control in AK
  \item Tropical degeneration \(\rightarrow\) VMHS mechanism within geometric–algebraic linkage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appendix Correspondence and Theoretical Feedback}
Appendices B, E, and F in v3.2 support AK theory as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item B: Numerical PH stability \(\rightarrow\) Topological functional foundations
  \item E: Differentiability of \(C(t)\) \(\rightarrow\) Gradient structure of AK Lyapunov theory
  \item F: Dyadic shell decomposition \(\rightarrow\) Modal decomposition in AK topological structure
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Directions: Toward Categorical, Mirror Symmetric, and PDE Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Application to MHD, Euler, and SQG equations
  \item Categorical structure: Topos theory and derived categories for MECE classification
  \item Integration of SYZ mirror symmetry and tropical geometry
  \item Multi-layer PH (e.g., derived persistent modules)
\end{itemize}
